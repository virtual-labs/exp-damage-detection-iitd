#### This experiment aims to teach the user, through a database of measured data, how occurrence of damage in a structure changes the conductance signature (EMI technique). The test structure is an aluminium block (50 x 48 x 10 mm), having a surface bonded PZT patch (see Fig. 1a). To learn more about the EMI technique, click (<a href="http://ssdl.iitd.ac.in/vssdl/piezo.pdf" target="_blank">http://ssdl.iitd.ac.in/vssdl/piezo.pdf</a>).
