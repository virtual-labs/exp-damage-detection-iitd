### These steps will be followed for the experiment

<!-- **PRE EXPERIMENT TASK**

1) What is electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique?<br>
2) What is conductance? What is susceptance?<br>
3) Why does occurrence of damage alters the conductance signatures?<br>
4) What is RMSD? Write an expression for it?<br><br> -->

**Preparation of specimens:**

1. Click start experiment button to start the experiment.

<!-- **POST EXPERIMENT TASK**


1) Plot and compare conductance and susceptance signature of following:<br>
a) Incipient Damage<br>
b) Moderate Damage<br>
c) Severe Damage<br>
2) Compute RMSD for all above cases.<br> -->
